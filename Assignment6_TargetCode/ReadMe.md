In order to execute the program run the command 'make'.
This will automatically compute the Quad outputs and asm files for all 5 test cases.

In order to remove the files for re-execution run the command 'make clean' from the terminal.

In order to generate asm of individual test files run the command, after atleast once running 'make' (Executable asmGenerator must be created by this time):

./asmGenerator 1     (or the number corresponding to which test file to execute)
